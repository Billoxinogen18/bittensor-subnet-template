# Best Practices for Subnet Owners

Welcome, subnet owners! This guide provides an overview of best practices for your Bittensor subnet. We'll focus on three critical areas: feature completeness, containerization, and semantic versioning. For detailed information on each topic, please refer to the specific documentation linked below.

## Feature Completeness

Ensuring your subnet is feature-complete is crucial for its success and adoption. Key considerations include:

1. Defining clear objectives
2. Comprehensive planning
3. Thorough testing
4. Documentation
5. Performance optimization
6. Security measures

For a detailed guide on achieving feature completeness, see [@best_practices/feature_completeness].

## Containerization

Containerization is essential for consistent deployment and scalability. Important aspects include:

1. Using Docker
2. Implementing multi-stage builds for security and efficiency
3. Utilizing environment variables for deployment flexibility
4. Planning for persistent storage
5. Managing resources
6. Considering container orchestration

## Semantic Versioning

Adopting semantic versioning (SemVer) helps users understand the impact of updates and ensures compatibility. Key points include:

1. Using the correct version format
2. Following increment rules
3. Handling pre-release versions
4. Maintaining version in code
5. Keeping a changelog
6. Using Git tags
7. Git repo tag and Dockerhub image tag consistency
