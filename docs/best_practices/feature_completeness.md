# Feature Completeness

When developing your subnet, it's crucial to ensure feature completeness to provide a smooth experience for both validators and miners. Here are some key aspects to consider:

## Implementation of Essential Flags

Implement and thoroughly test the following flags in your subnet:

- `--neuron.name`: Allows users to assign a custom name to their neuron.
- `--neuron.hotkey`: Specifies the hotkey for the neuron.
- `--neuron.coldkey`: Specifies the coldkey for the neuron.
- `--wallet.name`: Sets the name for the user's wallet.
- `--wallet.hotkey`: Specifies the hotkey for the wallet.
- `--wallet.coldkey`: Specifies the coldkey for the wallet.

These flags are essential for proper neuron and wallet management within the Bittensor ecosystem.

## Minimum Compute Requirements

Ensure that you fill out the `min_compute.yml` file in your subnet's repository. This file should specify the minimum hardware requirements for running a validator or miner on your subnet. Include details such as:

- Minimum CPU specifications
- Required RAM
- Recommended storage capacity
- Any specific GPU requirements (if applicable)

Providing this information helps users understand the resources needed to participate in your subnet effectively.

## Documentation for Starting and Running a Neuron

Create comprehensive documentation that guides users through the process of starting and running a neuron on your subnet. Include the following:

1. Prerequisites and environment setup
2. Installation instructions for your subnet
3. Step-by-step guide for initializing a neuron
4. Commands for starting a validator or miner
5. Explanation of key configuration options and flags
6. Troubleshooting tips and common issues

Ensure that your documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Testing Flexibility for Subnet Validators

Ensure that your subnet implementation includes the ability for validators to run without setting weights. This feature is crucial for testing purposes, allowing subnet owners to:

- Try out new versions of the code
- Evaluate changes in a controlled environment
- Debug issues without affecting the live network

Implement a flag or configuration option (e.g., `--no_set_weights`) that disables weight setting for validators. Document this feature clearly, explaining its purpose and how to use it safely.

By providing this testing flexibility, you enable subnet owners to iterate and improve their subnet implementation with confidence before deploying changes to the live network.

By addressing these aspects, you'll enhance the usability and adoption of your subnet within the Bittensor network.
